** The TV Show Commenting System for Project Three **

---

## Description

The website will allow the user to make an account and search through shows from a third-party API, and then add these shows to a list of their favorites. All the shows have descriptions as well, so they can discover new programs to watch. They can also comment on shows, and see a list of all their favorites in their profile.

## Getting Started

This is the proposal repository for our project. This project is split into two functional repros: our front-end React application and our back end Express API. These repros can be located:

- **Front**: [https://git.generalassemb.ly/jonnycakes/tvflix-front](https://git.generalassemb.ly/jonnycakes/tvflix-front)
- **Back**: [https://git.generalassemb.ly/jonnycakes/tvflix-back](https://git.generalassemb.ly/jonnycakes/tvflix-back)
